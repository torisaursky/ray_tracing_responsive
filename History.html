            <h3>Rasterization</h3>
            <p>
                Before ray tracing, the go-to process for rendering 3D images was rasterization, a process that converts 3D images into 2D pixels. It does this by using polygons to render images and z values to determine depth and the order to render images in. Techniques like gouraud shading or phong shading light each polygon a certain amount depending on its proximity to a light source. Reflections often suffer when using rasterization, so that’s where pairing ray tracing with rasterization comes in.

            <h3>16th Century</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Albrecht Dürer created Dürer’s Door, an apparatus that would use thread attached to a stylus to essentially “trace” the 3-D object</li>
                <li>The thread used serves as the “ray” in this early concept</li>

            <h3>Ray Tracing Meets the Computer (Late 60s & 70s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1968: Arthur Appel was the first to accomplish computer ray tracing. He first traced to determine the closest surfaces to the camera for any given point, then a used secondary rays to determine whether or not that point was in shadow</li>
                <li>1971: Goldstein and Nagel simulated taking a photo in reverse; rays were cast through each pixel to identify a surface and determined the brightness of that pixel by keeping in mind the light source</li>
                <li>1976: Scott Roth creates a flip-book animation using ray casting to note edge points (intersections of planes)</li>
                <li>1979: Turner Whitted uses ray tracing for mirror reflection and refraction through translucent objects, anti-aliasing, and to trace shadows</li>
